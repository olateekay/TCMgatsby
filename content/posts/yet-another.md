it’s been a long time since my last post! I apologize. This software development journey ” IZ NOR BEANS!!!” It has had me questioning everything I believe in. Kai! these past 6 months has been draining with “Na village people send me come” type of bugs, crazy timelines and unbelievable deadlines. I work with a team of one back-end developer and another front-end developer on two enterprise apps, one of which has a multitenancy feature.

When I and my other front-end colleague were assigned to the project, we had to continue from where the last front-end guys stopped and we were expected to deliver in a very short time frame. The front-end of the apps was built with React Js and Redux Saga which I didn’t know much about. I was so afraid. So so intimated. I looked at the source code wondering to myself, “What in Heavens is componentDidMount? , this.setState? Chai! Won ti get mi!” In the midst of my fears and utter confusion, I summoned the courage and sought ways to learn React.Js. I read a lot of documentation, I enrolled for and watched Udemy courses on React.Js.

Little by little, it started making sense. Gradually I began to understand React components, React State, Lifecycle Methods. I was able to apply the knowledge gained to implement changes and fix bugs on the Apps.

Finally, after 6 months of development and debugging, the apps were delivered to the clients. It’s almost unbelievable how much I have learnt and how much I am able to do. I look back to where I began and I shudder. All it took was a leap of faith! I could have remained at the state I was, depressed and confused if I allowed the fear of past failures to discourage me. For the first time, I felt totally fulfilled about my career path totally confident and excited.

On May 1st, I received an email from our Human Resource office, converting me from an Intern to a full-time Software Engineer, Guys, I cried! Me? Simi’s mum, employed as a Software Engineer? Such joy has filled my soul. My story is a lesson to me, never lose faith. Stay Courageous! Be better!
